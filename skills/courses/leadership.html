            <h4>Leadership Theories</h4>
            <p>Leadership is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been studied extensively. Here are some key
                theories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trait Theory:</strong> This theory suggests that certain individuals possess inherent traits
                    that make them effective leaders, such as intelligence, confidence, and charisma.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Theory:</strong> This approach focuses on the behaviors of leaders rather than
                    their traits, emphasizing that effective leadership can be learned through observation and practice.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Situational Leadership:</strong> This theory posits that no single leadership style is best;
                    instead, effective leaders adapt their style based on the situation and the needs of their team.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Transformational Leadership:</strong> Transformational leaders inspire and motivate their
                    followers to exceed their own self-interests for the good of the organization, fostering an
                    environment of collaboration and innovation.</li>
                <li><strong>Servant Leadership:</strong> This philosophy emphasizes the leader's role as a servant
                    first, prioritizing the needs of the team and helping them develop and perform as highly as
                    possible.</li>
            </ul>
